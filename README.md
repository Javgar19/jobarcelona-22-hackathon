# jobarcelona-22-hackathon
Code and results of the jobarcelona-22 hackathon for the data science modality

In this hackathon, the aim was to build a predictive ML model that classifies the specie of an insect based on the data from multiple sensors. The final developed model
is a Deep Feed Forward Neural Network, built with Tensorflow.

In the file "hackathon.ipynb" you can find a Jupyter notebook with the Exploratory Data Analysis along with the study of different models.
